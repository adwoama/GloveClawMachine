# Glove Claw Machine

A Unity project that uses a wearable sensor glove to control a virtual claw machine.

## Description

This project enables users to interact with a virtual claw machine in Unity using a wearable sensor glove. The glove's sensors detect hand movements and gestures, translating them into controls for operating the claw machine in the virtual environment.

## Requirements

- Unity (compatible version specified in ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt)
- Wearable sensor glove hardware
- Claw machine 3D asset (see below)

## Claw Machine Asset

The claw machine 3D model and textures are not included in this repository. You can download the asset for free from Sketchfab:
